# unix-shell-in-ruby

## Definitions

Spawn in computing refers to a function that loads and exectures a new child process. The current process may wait for the child to terminate or may continue to execute concurrent computing. Creating a new subprocess requires enough memory in which both the child process and the current program can execute.
